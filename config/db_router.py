"""
config/db_router.py — Phase 2 (new file)
=========================================
Routes all ORM read queries to the Postgres streaming replica, and all
write queries (INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE) to the primary.

How it works:
  - Django calls db_for_read() before every SELECT.
  - Django calls db_for_write() before every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.
  - allow_migrate() prevents the migration runner from touching the replica
    (it is read-only; migrations only apply to the primary).

Usage — registered in settings.py:
    DATABASE_ROUTERS = ['config.db_router.ReadReplicaRouter']

Impact:
  - The Postgres primary handles only the bulk upsert writes from the
    processing service.
  - All Django ORM reads (PostViewSet, stats aggregates, admin) hit the
    replica, keeping the primary connection count low.
  - Effective query throughput roughly doubles with no hardware changes.
